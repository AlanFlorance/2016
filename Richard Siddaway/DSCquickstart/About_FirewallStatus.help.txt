    About_FirewallStatus

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    A sample DSC resource built with a PowerShell 5.0 class.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The DSC resource enables you to toggle the Windows firewall on or off for 
    each profile - Domain, Private, Public
 
    Even though the class itself has a single setting, PowerShell will add a few 
    additional settings.
